# Airsoft kill-counter

The objective of this project is to create a simple yet stylish airsoft kill counter that can be attached to the barrel of your replica. The current goal is to develop a straightforward 4-digit display with two buttons (increment and reset). Additionally, I aim to offer various versions so it could be compatible with most rail systems.
