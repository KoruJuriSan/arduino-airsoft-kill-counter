# Airsoft kill-counter

The objective of this project is to create a simple yet stylish airsoft kill counter that can be attached to the barrel of your replica. The current goal is to develop a straightforward 4-digit display with two buttons (increment and reset). Additionally, I aim to offer various versions so it could be compatible with most rail systems.

## TODO before first version

### Conception
[] Create a class to control the 7 segments 4 digits.
[] Create a class to control the reset & add button.
[] Separate the classes into files.
[] Make a list of all final compoants for the project.
[] Create a 3D model to put the componants together on a Picatinny rail.

### Finishing
[] Add documentation for the code.
[] Rename methods to better reflect their actual use.
[] Split code into smaller parts (1-5 lines per method).
[] finish github sections.
